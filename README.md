<h1 align="center">MAZE Solver 🔍</h1>

Maze is one of the oldest games in the world and solving them and the methods of solving them is one of the oldest problems in the world. 👾

A simple Python program that *finds the closest path between two points in a maze* using a **recursive algorithm**. 🔩

Today, different algorithms are provided with different speeds ‌‌and efficiency, but sometimes they have problems. This algorithm is a simple algorithm that may not be an optimal program in terms of speed and system usage, but instead it is a complete algorithm that can always reach the answer.

> If you have a better method in mind or you can increase its effectiveness with changes in my program, I will be happy to share it with me. 🔖🔱

## 📑 files Description : 

- The main core of the program is located in the [*table_c.py*](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/MAZE_s/table_c.py) and all the calculation and main parts of the program are carried out by this part. (This program has the ability to calculate mazes of any size.)

- [*terminal_base.py*](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/MAZE_s/terminal_base.py) is a basic and simple version of the program whose output is displayed in the terminal.

- [*MAZE_Solver.py*](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/MAZE_Solver.py) is the final program with a graphical user interface and is the final version of the work.
(In the final version, some features of the core are not used, such as the ability to calculate different sizes, instead, some features have been displayed more easily and better, such as displaying the calculation steps or drawing the initial maze.)

- [*telemessage.py*](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/MAZE_s/telemessage.py) is a simple program to receive messages and comments from people in the program and send them to my *Telegram*, although the *token and ID bot* are hidden, you can insert your token and ID bot instead and start using this section.

##  🚀 Get Started

* If you are using *Windows* and just want to try the final program on your system, just *click , download and install* the [**MAZE_Solver_Installer.exe**](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/MAZE_Solver_Installer.exe?raw=true) file. (this is a installer for windows) 📦
  > * In this version, you can send me your comments about the program anonymously. 📩

* If you use Linux or ... or want to use all the features of the program or have a clone of the code for yourself, just run the following commands :💯

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver.git
```
> To run with python use this command:
> ```console
> $ python3.X MAZE_Solver.py
> ```

## 🔧 Requirements : 

If you download the installation file, you don't need to install anything extra, but if you clone the file for yourself, you need [*Python 3.7*](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher and you need to install the related libraries through the following commands from inside the [**requirements.txt**](https://github.com/supernova-Z313/Maze_Solver/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.

```console
$ pip3.X install -r Requirements.txt
```

## 💡Ideas :

1. A variety of faster and better algorithms. 📊

2. How to save mazes better and process saved files. 📥

3. Creating a graphical interface with the ability to change the size of the maze. 📐

4. Using the canvas instead of buttons to draw shapes better and make the program faster. 🖌
